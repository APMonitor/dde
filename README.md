# Data-Driven Engineering

Data engineering is the process of collecting and refining data. Clean and accessible data is an important preparatory step for many use cases that extract information and value from data. Data engineering is foundational to visualization, clustering, classification, regression, and other machine learning methods. This introductory course is on science and engineering applications of data science with particular emphasis on practical applications and specific examples.

The course combines mathematical details with several case studies that provide an intuition for data engineering solutions. A second phase of the course is a hands-on group project. The engineering problems and theory guide the student towards a working fluency in state-of-the-art methods implemented in Python.
